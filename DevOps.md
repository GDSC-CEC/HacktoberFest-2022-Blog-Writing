# DEVOPS

DevOps is a combination of software developers (dev) and operations (ops). It is defined as a software engineering methodology which aims to integrate the work of software development and software operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility. DevOps combines development and operations to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. 

The DevOps methodology comprises four key principles that guide the effectiveness and efficiency of application development and deployment. These principles, listed below, center on the best aspects of modern software development.

1.Automation of the software development lifecycle.

2.Collaboration and communication.

3.Continuous improvement and minimization of waste.

4.Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops.

By adopting these principles, organizations can improve code quality, achieve a faster time to market, and engage in better application planning.



# The four phases of DevOps 
As DevOps has evolved, so has its complexity. This complexity is driven by two factors:

1.Organizations are moving from monolithic architectures to microservices architectures. As DevOps matures, organizations need more and more DevOps tools per project.

2.The result of more projects and more tools per project has been an exponential increase in the number of project-tool integrations. This necessitated a change in the way organizations adopted DevOps tools.


## Phase 1: Bring Your Own DevOps 
In the Bring Your Own DevOps phase, each team selected its own tools. This approach caused problems when teams attempted to work together because they were not familiar with the tools of other teams.

## Phase 2: Best-in-class DevOps 
To address the challenges of using disparate tools, organizations moved to the second phase, Best-in-class DevOps. In this phase, organizations standardized on the same set of tools, with one preferred tool for each stage of the DevOps lifecycle. It helped teams collaborate with one another, but the problem then became moving software changes through the tools for each stage.

## Phase 3: Do-it-yourself DevOps 
To remedy this problem, organizations adopted Do-it-yourself (DIY) DevOps, building on top of and between their tools. They performed a lot of custom work to integrate their DevOps point solutions together. However, since these tools were developed independently without integration in mind, they never fit quite right. For many organizations, maintaining DIY DevOps was a significant effort and resulted in higher costs, with engineers maintaining tooling integration rather than working on their core software product.

## Phase 4: DevOps Platform 
A single-application platform approach improves the team experience and business efficiency. GitLab, The DevOps Platform, replaces DIY DevOps, allowing visibility throughout and control over all stages of the DevOps lifecycle.



# How DevOps can benefit from AI/ML? 
AI and machine learning (ML) are still maturing in their applications for DevOps, but there is plenty for organizations to take advantage of today, including using the technology to make sense of test data.

AI and ML can find patterns, figure out the coding problems that cause bugs, and alert DevOps teams so they can dig deeper.

Similarly, DevOps teams can use AI and ML to sift through security data from logs and other tools to detect breaches, attacks, and more. Once these issues are found, AI and ML can respond with automated mitigation techniques and alerting.

AI and ML can save developers and operations professionals time by learning how they work best, making suggestions within workflows, and automatically provisioning preferred infrastructure configurations.


# What is the goal of DevOps? 
DevOps represents a change in mindset for IT culture. In building on top of Agile and lean practices, DevOps focuses on incremental development and rapid delivery of software. Success relies on the ability to create a culture of accountability, improved collaboration, empathy, and joint responsibility for business outcomes.

Adopting a DevOps strategy enables businesses to increase operational efficiencies, deliver better products faster, and reduce security and compliance risk.



# How does DevOps support the cloud-native approach? 
Moving software development to the cloud has so many advantages that more and more companies are adopting cloud-native computing. Building, testing, and deploying applications from the cloud saves money because organizations can scale resources more easily, support faster software shipping, align with business goals, and free up DevOps teams to innovate rather than maintain infrastructure.

Cloud-native application development enables developers and operations teams to work more collaboratively, which results in better software delivered faster.



# What is a DevOps engineer? 
A DevOps engineer is responsible for all aspects of the software development lifecycle, including communicating critical information to the business and customers. Adhering to DevOps methodologies and principles, they efficiently integrate development processes into workflows, introduce automation where possible, and test and analyze code. They build, evaluate, deploy, and update tools and platforms (including IT infrastructure if necessary). DevOps engineers manage releases, as well as identify and help resolve technical issues for software users.

DevOps engineers require knowledge of a range of programming languages and a strong set of communication skills to be able to collaborate among engineering and business groups.
