# **DevOps**
I'm pretty sure that you've heard the word "DevOps" before. Still, you may not know what it actually means, or you are probably wondering whether DevOps is any tool or software that you need to master to become a DevOps Engineer. Don't worry at all, in this blog I'll clear all of your doubts regarding DevOps. So, let's startüöÄ.

## **Need for DevOps**
Before diving deep into DevOps let's just spend some time understanding the need for DevOps. For small applications, DevOps is not necessary as you can handle everything from development to deployment by yourself but as your application starts growing and more users start using your application then you'll realize the importance of DevOps. Big companies like Amazon, Netflix, etc. use the DevOps approach as millions and billions of people are using their applications.

Basically, software development is divided into two parts. The first one is the "Development team" whose role is to design, develop and build the software while the other one is the "Operation team" which is responsible for testing, implementation, and deployment of the software. Sometimes there can be miscommunication between these two teams which results in delayed releases, system crashes, etc.

Therefore, we need some kind of methodology so that the entire process of application from development to deployment can go smoothly. That's where the concept of DevOps comes in handy.

DevOps helps in removing the communication and collaboration barriers between development and operation teams along with the fast delivery of the product hence improving customer satisfaction.

DevOps encourages faster, better, more secure delivery of the product to the end customers. It involves how quickly a product release or new feature gets into customers‚Äô hands‚Äîall with the proper levels of quality and security. Or, it might focus on how quickly an issue or bug is identified, and then resolved and re-released.

## **What is DevOps?ü§î**
DevOps is neither a programming language nor software that you can use and master. DevOps consists of two words, Development and Operation. DevOps is actually a philosophy, tool, and practice that helps the development and operation team so that they can deliver the application and services efficiently.

Following are the benefits of DevOps:
* Faster and better product delivery
* Faster issue resolution and reduced complexity
* Greater scalability, reliability, and availability
* Automation and better security
* Improved collaboration

Now, let's take a close look at each segment of the DevOps one by one.

## **DevOps Lifecycleü§©**

As you can see that the DevOps lifecycle consists of eight phases representing the plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate and monitor. Here the processes on the left are the part of Development and the processes on the right are the part of the operation. As it is an infinite process hence the logo of DevOps represents infinity.

The different processes are:

1. Plan: This phase helps define business value and requirements. Sample tools include Jira or Git to help track known issues and perform project management.

2. Code: This phase involves software design and the creation of software code. Sample tools include GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Stash.

3. Build: In this phase, you manage software builds and versions, and use automated tools to help compile and package code for future releases to production. You use source code repositories or package repositories that also ‚Äúpackage‚Äù infrastructure needed for product release. Sample tools include Docker, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Gradle, Maven, or JFrog Artifactory.

4. Test: This phase involves continuous testing (manual or automated) to ensure optimal code quality. Sample tools include JUnit, Codeception, Selenium, Vagrant, TestNG, or BlazeMeter.

5. Releases: In this phase, a build is ready for deployment into the production environment

6. Deploy: This phase can include tools that help manage, coordinate, schedule, and automate product releases into production. Sample tools include Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Jenkins, Kubernetes, OpenShift, OpenStack, Docker, or Jira.

7. Operate: This phase manages software during production. Sample tools include Ansible, Puppet, PowerShell, Chef, Salt, or Otter.

8. Monitor: This phase involves identifying and collecting information about issues from a specific software release in production. Sample tools include New Relic, Datadog, Grafana, Wireshark, Splunk, Nagios, or Slack.

## **DevOps Best Practicesüòé**
1. Continuous Integration
2. Continuous Delivery
3. Microservices
4. Infrastructures as Code
5. Monitoring and logging
6. Communication and Collaboration

## **DevOps Tools‚öíÔ∏è**

Docker - Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Kubernetes - Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Helm - Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Terraform - Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.

Ansible - Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.

Packer - Packer is a tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.

Vault - Vault is a tool for managing secrets. Secrets are any sensitive data that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more.

Nomad - Nomad is a tool for managing a cluster of Linux containers or Windows containers. Nomad is easy to operate and scale, and can run anywhere from laptops to large data centers.

Consul - Consul is a tool for discovering and configuring services in your infrastructure. It provides several key features, including a service catalog, health checking, and a KV store.

Vagrant - Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow.

Jenkins - Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

Drone - Drone is a Continuous Delivery platform built on Docker, written in Go.

Gitlab CI - GitLab CI/CD is a set of continuous integration and continuous delivery features included with GitLab that allows you to test, build, and deploy your code.

CircleCI - CircleCI is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform. It helps software teams rapidly release code with confidence by automating the build, test, and deploy process.

Travis CI - Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.

AWS - Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

GCP - Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube.

Azure - Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

## **Challenges that DevOps tries to solveü§î**
- Miscommunication and lack of collaboration
- Conflict of interests between Development team and Operation team
- Security
- Application Testing
