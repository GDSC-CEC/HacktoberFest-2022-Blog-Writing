Cryptocurrency is a virtual currency that is encrypted by codes using Blockchain technology. The encryption process makes the currency secure against counterfeit. At the moment cryptocurrencies are legal financial assets but they are not recognized as legal tender by countries except El Salvador which means, these assets hold value but cannot be used for the sale or purchase of commodities yet. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified in an interview that since cryptocurrency is not issued by a centralized authority it does not have the intrinsic value that makes a currency acceptable as a medium of exchange. So, cryptocurrency is an asset, not a currency.

**Feasibility of Financial Transactions**
Conventional financial transactions need several intermediaries besides the payee and the recipient of money such as the financial institutions holding the bank accounts of both the parties, the platform used for the transaction etc. All these players charge fees for providing their services making transactions expensive for customers. A greater number of intermediaries involved in the transaction process gives hackers more chances to steal sensitive personal information of people.

**How secure is cryptocurrency?**
The security that cryptographic proof provides to digital asset transactions is not easy to break. Every transaction that gets initiated in the crypto-financial system needs to be verified by the majority of the ledger network distributed across the internet. The transaction gets rejected if this does not happen. Also, transactions are verified through mining, a process of solving complex algorithms. This process consumes a lot of energy making it expensive and takes a significant amount of time to get noticed if anything is fishy.

**Conclusion**
Acceptance of the digital currency system by the Indian state is a prudent move considering the pace at which the crypto financial system is expanding itself. Although, it would be a challenge for the state to devise a mechanism that lets cryptocurrency function without losing its essence.
