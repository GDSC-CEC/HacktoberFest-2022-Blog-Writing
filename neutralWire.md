## *What is 5G?* üßê
* 5G is the 5th generation mobile network. It is a new global wireless standard after 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. 5G enables a new kind of network that is designed to connect virtually everyone and everything together including machines, objects, and devices.
* 5G wireless technology is meant to deliver higher multi-Gbps peak data speeds, ultra low latency, more reliability, massive network capacity, increased availability, and a more uniform user experience to more users. Higher performance and improved efficiency empower new user experiences and connects new industries.

### *5G is good for India for the following reasons:*

**1. High speeds**

5G works faster on mobile phones and other devices when compared to 4G and 4G LTE. It allows users to download movies, videos, and music in seconds as opposed to minutes. 

**2. Low latency**

5G has low latency when compared to 4G that will support new applications such as AI, IoT, and virtual reality efficiently. Not only that, it enables mobile phone users to open a webpage and browse things without any hassles.

**3. Increased capacity**

5G has the capacity to deliver up to 100 times more capacity than 4G. It allows companies to switch between cellular and Wi-Fi wireless strategies that will help a lot to experience better performance.

**4. More bandwidth**

One of the main advantages of 5G is that it increases more bandwidth that will help transfer the data as soon as possible. Furthermore, mobile phone users can ensure a faster connection with more bandwidth after choosing a 5G network. 

**5. Powering innovation**

5G technology is the perfect choice for connecting with a whole range of different devices including drones and sensors. It gives ways to power the adoption of IoT allowing industries to enhance their productivity and other things. 

**6. Less tower congestion**

4G cellular networks often get congested which will result in various problems while accessing important data. On the other hand, 5G networks allow users to avoid them due to better speed and more bandwidth.

**7. Virtual medical operation**

This ultimately can help in virtual surgery which can be performed from a remote location. Patients don't have to wait for too long if the doctors is not available.

## *Disadvantages OF 5G Technology:*

**1. Limited Coverage**

While 5G technology is touted to have the fastest speed, its presence in only select cities globally that have 5G towers is one of the limitations of this technology.

**2. Weak Upload Speeds**

Experts believe that despite its ability to have faster download speeds, 5G technology will have less upload speed compared to 4G and 4G LTE. This is another drawback of 5G technology. 

**3. Battery Damages**

Another limitation of 5G technology is it weakens the cellular device, by draining the battery and reducing the lifespan. So far only a few manufacturers have introduced mobile phones that are 5G friendly. 

**4. Interference With Airport And Flight Operations**

In January this year, several airlines including Air India canceled their flights to the US as the telecom operators in the country were trying to roll out 5G operations in the country.

**5. Cybersecurity Risk**

Another drawback of 5G technology is it increases the risk of hacking thus impinging on cybersecurity.
